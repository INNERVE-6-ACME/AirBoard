## 3rd prize at INNERVE Hackathon 6.0 (AIT Pune)
### 3rd/823 participations

Problem Addressed:
The inability of students without digital pads / touch-input laptops to express themselves effectively in online classes, leading to lack of communication in online studies.

Solution Approach:
- The teacher and students in a class can turn on their cameras and write in the air using hand gestures . 
- Live broadcast of every such drawing to all other students in form of a whiteboard (can be saved after each session for later reference) .
- This would result in more interest and participation of everyone in an online class.
